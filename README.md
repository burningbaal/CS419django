# Senior Capstone - django server for Limbo project
**CS419 Fall 2016**
*Oregon State University*
*Keith McKinley - primary server developer*

## Assignment
* The assignment was to create a software solution to a defined problem, which was defined (I use that word loosely since it was for a class) in *Requirements.rtf*
* A solution was planned and detailed in *Project Plan - Limbo.rtf*
* The final server solution is the bulk of this repository; the server was my assigned part of the responsibility, the other group members were responsible for the client (Windows 7 or later) and the database, respectively

## Development
* **Contributors:** The vast majority of the server commits are my own, on the Contributors tab, you can see kmckinleyAdaptive and burningbaal, both of which are me.
martamae was a group member
* **Branches:** The bulk of the commits were to *master* since this was not a production system and it was almost-exclusively by a single developer. There were a couple efforts I made where I wasn't sure if they would work out, so they show in separate branches.

**Project Notes:**
- I liked how the asset lookup dialog box returned error results in its status field if it couldn't find the asset in the DB.
- The system is up and working!
- There is a LOT of data being tracked, managed, and kept safe on the backend! I would so far as to say that the backend is a larger project than the front end!
- Amazing amount of controls involved in managing all the data.
- Clicking "View service info..." caused the front end app to crash every time.

OK, this is amazing stuff. NOW I'm catching the vision of what you're trying to do. This is a great project you've dreamed up and executed on!

Remember to use this Project and Report to help you get jobs, everyone, which I don't think will be hard for you to do. You've done great work this term through all the ups and down. You've easily earned an A. Good luck out there, and I hope you remember your time fondly at OSU. Congratulations, once again! Go Beavs,
